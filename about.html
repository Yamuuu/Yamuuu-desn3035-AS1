        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            When designers design for accessibility they rely on guidelines, but that doesn't mean they'll understand because they can't see what in the way a person with visual impairment would see.
            
            Universal design is creating a design that is accessible to the most. Even if they aren't designed to be accessible they should still be inclusive.

    <div id="intro">
        <h3>What is Spective?</h3>
        <p>Spective is meant to be a tool for designers to help them visualize and empathize when designing for Visual Impairment. Design can often prioritize aesthetics over function, function that is especially important when dealing with visual impairment. Though the best accessible design is done in collaboration with designers that have disabilities, this is something that can provide a secondary perspective. </p>
